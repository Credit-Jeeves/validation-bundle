            <p>
                {{ groupName }} has teamed up with Credit Jeeves to help you understand your credit score and achieve your financing goals.
                The Credit Jeeves program shows you your current credit score, a summary of your credit profile, and a customized action plan to help
                you reach your target score. We then monitor your progress over the next few months to let you know when you are likely qualified for a loan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enrollment is free, simple, and takes less than a minute. Credit Jeeves will not negatively impact your credit and does not post a
                'hard inquiry.'
            </p>
            <p>
                Set up your Credit Jeeves Account now at <a href="{{ inviteLink }}">{{ inviteLink }}</a> and take the first step towards better financing.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will be able to:
                * See and monitor your current credit score.
                * Follow easy-to-understand actions to optimize your score for your goals.
                * See a summary of your credit file and learn more about how this information affects your score.
                * Receive alerts when you reach your target score.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Tip: Do not shop around for a loan right now. This will create multiple 'hard inquiries' on your credit file which can negatively
              impact your score. Credit Jeeves makes a 'soft inquiry' and will allow you to view your score and action plan without hurting your
              chances to requalify for a loan in the future.
            </p>

        Your tenant, {{ fullNameTenant }}, would like to use RentTrack to pay rent on your property at
        {{ address }} {{ unitName }}. RentTrack allows {{ nameTenant }} to build credit history by
        reporting on-time payments to credit bureaus. <br /> <br />

        As a landlord, you benefit because RentTrack facilitates easy payments through secure electronic
        check transfers and credit cards - payments are deposited faster and directly to your account.
        Reminders are sent automatically to your tenants before rent is due and late notices are sent
        to you immediately. If you have multiple properties, you can see the status of your payments
        all in one place. Top top it off, your tenant has an additional incentive to pay
        on time each month.<br /> <br />
